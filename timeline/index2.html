            <h2> Welcome to the Wonderful World of Harry Potter </h2>
            <p> British author J.K. Rowling kicked off the world wide phenomenon that is the Harry Potter franchise in 1997 with the publication of "Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone." The novel introduced the world to Harry Potter on his eleventh birthday as he learns that he is a wizard and all of the excitement, drama and danger that ensues as he dives deeper into the world. 

            The multi-billion-dollar film franchise was kicked off in 2001 with the release of the first film starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The franchise includes eight films and brought in over $7 billion dollars throughout its ten year span. </p>
