<p>The devastation wrought by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian in Puerto Rico, Florida, and beyond has once again thrust weather and climate disasters to the forefront of the nation’s attention. 

<br>
<br>

According to NOAA, the U.S. has experienced 15 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each in 2022 (as of September 30). The total cost of these disasters through the end of September was $29.3 billion. Adding up the final costs will take months after the end of the year to complete.

<br>
<br>

The costly and deadly billion-dollar disasters of 2022 so far have included: an April tornado outbreak in the Southeast that spawned 88 tornadoes, including several intense, long tracked tornadoes in Georgia and South Carolina a May hail storm that left large swaths of golf-ball sized hail across Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota a destructive derecho that produced widespread 70+ mph wind gusts across the lower Midwest. 

<br>
<br>



The costs of Hurricane Fiona and Hurricane Ian are still being accounted for as ongoing recovery continues. Historically, hurricanes and tropical cyclones are the most costly disasters by far, averaging $21 billion per event—more than double the average toll of the next most costly event type (drought).</p>

<h3>More Disasters</h3>

<p>This year’s mounting extreme weather costs reflect an increasing trend in billion-dollar disasters across the U.S. 

<div class="callout secondary" style="font-size:1.5rem; font-style:italic; background-color:#C3DFEA">"Each decade since the 1980s has experienced more billion-dollar disasters and higher costs than the decade before." 
- ClimateCentral.Org</div>

Over the last five years (2017 to 2021) alone, a total of 89 events caused an estimated 4,557 deaths and over $788 billion dollars in damage. That’s 
about 35% of the $2.27 trillion in total costs of U.S. billion-dollar disasters from 1980-2021.

<br>
<br>

2022 is the eighth consecutive year with 10 or more billion-dollar weather and climate-related disasters. 

<br>
<br>

The long-term (1980–2021) annual average is 
about seven billion-dollar disasters per year. And 2022 follows the record-shattering annual totals of 22 and 20 billion-dollar disasters in 2020 and 2021, respectively.</p>

<h3>More Often</h3>

<p>
It's not just the total number of disasters—but how often they occur—that 
strains the resources available for communities to manage risks and 
recover quickly.

<br>
<br>

Between 1980-2021, the time between billion-dollar disasters in a calendar 
year has dropped steadily, according to an analysis by Climate Central.
The average time between billion-dollar disasters has dropped from 82 days 
in the 1980s to 26 days in the 2010s.

<br>
<br>

<br>

In the last five years (2017-2021), there have been just 18 days on 
average between billion-dollar disasters. During 2020, there were as little as two weeks on average between the record 22 billion-dollar disasters that year.
Less time between disasters can mean less time and resources available to 
respond, recover and prepare for future events.

<br>
<br>

The highest costs have resulted when multiple disasters occur in the same 
region and season, straining local resources—as during the Atlantic 
hurricane seasons of 2005 and 2017. According to NOAA, multiple billion-
dollar tropical cyclones during these two seasons resulted in more than 
5,000 lives lost and over $520 billion in combined damages.

</p>

<h3>The Full Toll of Disasters</h3>

<p> 
These staggering figures primarily reflect direct impacts on assets 
(including damage to homes, crops, and critical infrastructure), and 
therefore don’t reflect the full toll of disasters, including on public 
health—and especially mental health. According to the American Public 
Health Association, up to 54% of adults and 45% of children suffer 
depression after a disaster.

<br>
<br>

Weather and climate-related disasters can also result in widespread power 
outages (as occurred in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona), displacement, 
and limited or unsafe food and water supplies, as well as loss of cultural 
heritage, biodiversity and habitats.

<br>
<br>

These figures also don’t convey the disproportionate impacts of disasters 
on people in poverty or the need for equitable allocation of federal 
disaster assistance in accordance with social vulnerability.

<h3>Disasters in a Warming World</h3>
<p>
According to the latest IPCC reports, it is an “established fact” that 
human-caused greenhouse gas emissions have “led to an increased frequency 
and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial 
times.” And these trends are projected to continue with additional 
warming.

<br>
<br>

The ambition of the Paris Agreement—to limit warming to 2.7°F (1.5 °C) by 
2100—is very likely to be exceeded by the mid-2040s at the latest without 
rapid emissions cuts. In November, nearly 200 nations will convene at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) to accelerate climate 
action. Without such progress, we can expect even more frequent and 
intense billion-dollar disasters in the future.

<br>

<li> This year’s mounting extreme weather costs reflect an increasing trend in U.S. billion-dollar disasters since 1980.</li>

<li> The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has also increased. In the last five years (2017-2021), there were just 18 days on average between billion-dollar disasters—compared to 82 days in the 1980s.
Less time between disasters can mean less time and resources available to respond, recover and prepare for future events.</li>

<br>

<li> The full toll of such events—including the impacts on health—can’t be captured in any one statistic. Without rapid cuts in heat-trapping emissions, this toll is likely to keep rising.</li></ul>
