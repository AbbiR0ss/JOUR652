<h1> <p class="customgraph2" align="center">The Best Burger in Northwest Arkansas</h1>

<p> In addition all the other things I love about Fayetteville, it is also home to my favorite restaurant that owned by some of my favorite people. Feltner Brothers is a locally owned burger place nestled in the middle of town between a pizza place and guitar store. It's home to some of the best burgers in NWA and some of the friendliest people. It's owned by Grant, Chase and Travis Feltner. The brothers opened their first iteration of the store in 2009 on the beloved Dickson Street.

<p> In truly journalistic transparency, I might be a little biased when I say Feltner's has the best burger in town (although it has been voted the best three years in a row). I worked there as a server and manager for almost four years. I met some of my favorite people in the world while working there and made some great friends along the way.

<h2>So what should you try?</h2>

<p> The easy answer. A burger. That's truly most of what's on the menu. There's the classic Feltner with pickle, onion, tomato, lettuce and Feltner sauce for those wanting a tried and true classic. There's the Islander and Shroom Swissalaka for those looking to get a little more adventerous. My true love thought?

	<br><br>
The Brobecue. Grilled onions, bacon, cheddar cheese and Feltner sauce. A pro tip? Add pickles. It brings it all together.

<p class="customgraph">Fast food chicken was a staple of my undergraduate years at the University of Arkansas. Raising Cane's. Slim Chickens. Zaxby's. Chick-Fil-A. The options, while not endless, were numerous. Fast forward to fall 2022 and I'm a graduate student at the University of Maryland. All I want is some Cane's and all I am met with is sadness.
</p>

<h2>What options do we have in the DMV?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I have no idea. There is a Chick-Fil-A on campus...but does that really count. There is a Popeyes in College Park at least.</p> <--!
