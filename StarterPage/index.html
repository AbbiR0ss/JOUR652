<h1> <p class="customgraph2" align=center>Welcome to My Fan Page for Fayetteville, Arkansas! </p> </h1>

<h2>A home away from home</h2>

<p class="customgraph"> Nestled in the Ozark Mountains in the Northwest region of Arkansas is one of my favorite places in the world — Fayetteville. It's a college town of almost 80,000 and where I spent my undergraduate career. It's regularly ranked as one of the best places to live in the U.S. and it's understandable. It's home to some great people, businesses and only a short trip away from places like Tulsa and Oklahoma City. And if you're up for a little more of a drive Dallas, St. Louis and Kansas City are all under six hours away.

<h3>Home of the Arkansas Razorbacks and more</h3>

<p> Fayetteville is home to the University of Arkansas, my alma mater and home of the Arkansas Razorbacks. While the football team is known for being the Heartbreak Hogs, most other sports at the UofA are top tier. 

If sports aren't your thing, Fayetteville is a hub for locally owned coffee shops and breweries. You could try a new one each day for at least two weeks before you ran out.

There's an incredible trail system called the Razorback Greenway that flows throughout the city and connects it to surroundings areas. There's also great hiking in the area. For those looking for something a little less outdoorsy, Crystal Bridges Museum of Art is only 20 minutes away in Bentonville — the home of several Fortune 500 companies including the Walmart home offices.
