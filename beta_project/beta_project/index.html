<h5><em>The Purple Line is a main source of construction frustrations for University of Maryland 
students, and new additions coming this winter mean increased work on campus.
</em></h5>

<h6><em>By Abbi Ross</em></h6>

<br>

<p> University of Maryland students can expect more construction work on campus in the coming 
weeks and months.

<br>
<br>

While that is not a surprise to most, it can still be frustrating when the commute home from class 
takes an extra 15 minutes or the sidewalk that was there yesterday is blocked off the next day. 

<br>
<br>

On and off campus offices are trying their best to make sure students are aware of changes and 
new projects, but it can still be annoying for students, staff and faculty.

For graduate student and undergrad alumni Will Beltran, one of his first memories of campus 
involves the evergreen construction.

<br>
<br>

“My first memory of being here was back in 2016 when I toured here, and the new Cole Field 
House was under construction,” Beltran said. 

<br>
<br>

While the field house renovation  was completed by the time he made it campus as a freshman 
in 2018, the campuses neverending list of projects continues on strong.

<br>
<br>

Beltran said there has been a lot of work done on campus in his four, soon to be five years on 
campus. While he said the construction on the 77,000-square-foot public policy building that 
was completed earlier this was a lot at times since he lived on South Campus, it is the Purple 
Line work that is the most notable.

<br>
<br>

“That’s been the most annoying thing because it causes weird traffic jams,” Beltran said. “It’s the 
roadway going down the middle of campus and it gets used all the time. I honestly don’t 
remember it being a two way road since I’ve been here. It might have been my first semester.”

Work related to the Purple Line is actually not under the University of Maryland’s control, said 
Bill Olen, the Executive Director of Planning and Construction at UMD. 

<br>
<br>

The construction on campus is not all under Olen’s department, some projects like the Purple 
Line fall under the state.

<br>
<br>

“A lot of what you see on campus is associated with the Purple Line,” Olen said.

<br>
<br>

The Purple Line will be a 16-mile light rail line extending from Bethesda to New Carrollton, 
according to the project website. It will cost an estimated $3.4 billion to construct.

<br>
<br>

This year’s mounting extreme weather costs reflect an increasing trend in billion-dollar disasters across the U.S. 

The groundbreaking for the line was held in Aug. 2017 and work was originally slated to be 
completed in 2022, but complications with the original contractor pushed that back to 2026, said 
Courtney Brown, senior project manager for the office of the vice president

A new build contractor, Maryland Transit Solutions, was officially signed on in April, according to 
UMD’s Purple Line website. 

<br>
<br>

On-campus work was able to continue at a smaller level throughout the changes though, Brown 
said.

<br>
<br>

“We’ve had continued work on campus,” Brown said. “The new contractor came on board earlier 
this year and mobilized over the summer in various places on the alignment. They are 
scheduled to mobilize on campus in more substantial ways in mid-December and a major 
mobilization at the end of the fall semester.”

<br>
<br>

Once active the line will give students new access to the community.

<br>
<br>

<div class="callout secondary" style="font-size:1.5rem; font-style:italic; background-color:#D3D3D3">“It's going to be fantastic," Brown said. "In terms of increasing the connectivity of campus to the 
local area, the greater region and even beyond."</div>

It will provide a direct connection to the Red, Green and Orange Lines on the Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metro. It will also connect to Amtrak, MARC and bus 
services. 

<br>
<br>

Brown said that making sure students, faculty and staff know what is going on with the 
construction is a big focus as they move toward more substantial work on campus. There will be 
communication campaigns as it gets closer to the time of work starting as well.

<br>
<br>

Those interested can also sign up for construction alerts by texting UMDPURPLE to 888777, 
Brown said. There is also a Campus Construction Notice page for the Purple Line on the 
University of Maryland website.

<br>
<br>

While the Purple Line might be the biggest project on campus for the time being, there are many 
others ongoing as well.

<br>
<br>

The three largest project’s that Olen’s office is currently responsible for is the renovation of 
Woods Hall, the new Wing 1 of the chemistry building and the field hockey and women’s 
lacrosse renovation and addition.

<br>
<br>

“There are a lot of smaller projects, but those are the three big ones that I say are the most 
noticeable,” Olen said.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Olen said the impact of these three projects should be minimal to students.


<br>
<br>

Olen has seen a lot of growth at the University of Maryland and throughout the institution's other 
campuses in his seven years as executive director of planning and construction.

<br>
<br>

“Just in the last several years we’ve added about a million square feet of new space on campus 
in either academic housing or dining,” Olen said.

<br>
<br>

This includes the Heritage Community, the Edward St. John Learning and Teaching Center, Clark Hall and the public policy building. 

<br>
<br>

With constant construction, comes complaints.
Olen said they receive two main complaints — about pathways around construction sites and 
complaints from dormitories when construction is near them.

<br>
<br>

The department has made an effort in recent years to make sure students have safe pathways 
and that they are well marked. This work includes widening sidewalks, adding streetlights and 
making sure students know about the new routes.

<br>
<br>

To address issues with work around the dormitories, Olen said they have implemented quiet 
hours around the residence halls and avoid work on weekends. 

<br>
<br>

Beltran said that while annoying at times, he knows that the work is needed. 

<br>
<br>

“Progress has to be done,” Beltran said.
